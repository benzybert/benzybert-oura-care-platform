# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working on this repo. Read `README.md` and `docs/` for detail; this file is the short version plus the rules that must not be broken.

## What this is

Oura-based member health platform with three views over one dataset: member (`/member`), care team (`/care`), organization (`/org`). Health data, so **consent is the foundation**. Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, TS), Postgres + Drizzle, Oura API v2, Vercel, Vitest. Node 22+.

- Repo: `benzybert/benzybert-oura-care-platform`
- Vercel project: `oura-care-platform`
- UI language is **Hebrew, RTL**. Keep new UI text in Hebrew and layouts RTL-safe (works at phone width).

## Where things live

```
src/app/            pages (member, care, org), server actions (actions.ts), API routes
src/components/     shared UI (metrics-table, logout-button, share-link card)
src/components/doctor-dashboard/  the doctor dashboard: dashboard.tsx (server), trend-chart.tsx (client SVG), dashboard.css (tokens)
src/db/             Drizzle schema + connection
src/lib/            pure logic (alerts, consent, rewards, summary) + server helpers (queries, session)
src/lib/oura/       OAuth client, API mapping, sync
scripts/seed.ts     synthetic demo data
drizzle/            generated SQL migrations (never hand-edit applied ones)
docs/               ARCHITECTURE, PRIVACY, SETUP
```

## Workflow

Keep it simple: everything lives on **`main`**, and Vercel builds from it. This is a fast-moving side project: commit and push to `main` without asking for approval. No PRs or feature branches unless the user asks.

1. Before pushing: `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`.
2. Schema change: edit `src/db/schema.ts`, run `npm run db:generate`, commit the SQL file. Make sure the new migration's `when` in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` is later than the previous one, and enable RLS on any new table (see `0001`/`0002`). Do not run migrations against a real database without being asked; they must be applied to the Production database for the app to work.
3. Add or update a Vitest test for any change in `src/lib/` logic.

## Config lives in files, not env vars

Owner's instruction: this is a fast project and security matters less than speed. Put settings and keys (Resend API key, sender address) **in committed config files** such as `src/config/mail.ts`, not in Vercel env vars. Env vars may still override a file value but are never required. The owner explicitly accepts putting keys in code and accepts the security trade-off, and is switching the repo to **private**. Until the repo is private, a key in git is readable by anyone, so mention that once if you see it is still public.

## Rules that must not be broken

- **Server is the gatekeeper.** Pages call `requireRole`. Server actions re-check ownership and consent. Never rely on the UI to hide something.
- **Nothing is shared by default.** Consent scopes: `care_team`, `org_aggregate`, `rewards`. One scope never implies another. Consent history is append-only (revoke sets `revoked_at`; re-grant inserts a row).
- **No per-person view for employers or HR.** Org views show group means only, hidden below `ORG_MIN_COHORT`.
- **Minimal data.** Do not add Oura scopes beyond `daily`, heart-rate time series, names, phone numbers or emails to the care view.
- **Audit.** Any new staff view or consent change writes to `audit_log`.
- **Secrets.** Never commit real values. Tokens stay encrypted (AES-256-GCM). `.env.example` is the only env file in git. Other people's contact details (e.g. doctor emails) stay in the database, never in source. Keys and settings follow "Config lives in files" above.
- **`DEMO_AUTH`** is on in Production by the owner's choice (no real auth needed for now, synthetic data). Turn it off if real member data is ever added.
- **No health data in URLs, logs or analytics.** Responses stay `no-store`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.

## Feature: "send to my doctors" (member page)

Built on `/member`: a card with two doctor roles (neurologist, family doctor). The member saves each doctor's name and email (table `doctor_contacts`, never in source), clicks "send", reviews the exact message on `/member/send/[role]`, and confirms. The server rebuilds the message from the database (`src/lib/doctor-share.ts`), sends it through Resend (`src/lib/mail.ts`, settings in `src/config/mail.ts`), and writes `share_to_doctor` to `audit_log` without the content.

Rules to keep:

- Member-initiated only, with the confirmation page. Never automatic.
- Separate from `care_team` consent: it neither reads nor widens it.
- Message content never goes in a URL or a log. No member name in the message; replies go to the member's own address.
- Doctor roles were not pre-filled: the user enters who is the neurologist and who is the family doctor.
- Not built: attachments, a free-text note (the lib supports one, the UI does not), retry or delivery tracking.

## Feature: doctor dashboard link (member page)

On `/member`, card "דאשבורד לרופא": the member creates a read-only link (`/share/<token>`) for a doctor, previews it on `/member/share/preview?days=30`, copies or shares it, sees how many times it was opened, and revokes it. Details in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#doctor-dashboard-links`.

- Table `share_links` (migration `0003`). Lookup by `sha256(token)` only; `token_enc` exists so the member can copy again. Never log or store the plain token anywhere else.
- `/share/[token]` re-checks status on every request. First screen (`ShareGate`) has no health data and no name; data only after the "open" POST (`openShareLink`), which audits `share_link_viewed` and sets a signed cookie scoped to that link's path. Unknown, expired and revoked links all get the same 404 page.
- Dashboard numbers come from `src/lib/doctor-dashboard.ts` (pure, tested). Thresholds mirror `src/lib/alerts.ts`; change both together. Only the window's slots go to client components.
- Do not add: member email, age band, data outside the window, care-team alerts or notes, analytics or third-party scripts on `/share`.
- Design: `dashboard.css` has three token layers scoped to `.dash` (primitives `--p-*`, semantic `--c-*`, component `--viz-*`); components use only `--c-*`/`--viz-*`. Chart colours `#0b84a5` (data) / `#c96a12` (attention) light, `#2a9fc0` / `#c9711f` dark, validated for colour-blind separation and 3:1 contrast; re-validate if you change them. Font: IBM Plex Sans Hebrew (self-hosted via `@fontsource`, no external requests). Charts keep time left to right (newest on the right) inside the RTL page. Print uses the light theme and opens the daily table.
- Server-only code must not import values from a `"use client"` file (shared helpers live in `doctor-dashboard/format.ts`).

## Not built yet (do not assume it exists)

Real authentication (only the demo login creates sessions), live Oura verification, alert delivery outside the app, data export and deletion, retention policy, legal review. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#open-items` and `docs/PRIVACY.md`.
